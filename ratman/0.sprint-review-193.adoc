= Ratman Sprint Review 193


=== 1. Improved FDS-Controller exception handling http://issuetracking.bsh-sdd.com/browse/FU-6836[FU-6836]

====== *Problem*: Exceptions without body are hard to follow

====== *Solution*: Introduce Exceptions with problem json details


* As a first step towards well established problem detail json we enable our services to return proper details as json in the case of any failure on a rest-endpoint
* See details on fields of the https://wiki.bsh-sdd.com/display/FU/2022-12-22+Sprint+193+Review[Problem Details fields]

** *Spring-services* return problem detail jsons when requested via accept-header "application/problem+json"

1. `Connect to ds`

2. `Try to get not existing ds`

3. `Try to call wrong method`

4. `Try to create incompatible configuration for btm`

** *Micronaut services* always return problem detail jsons

5. _Connect to firmware-packaging-service_
6. _Generate micronaut errors_

=== 2. [OEM] separate package persistence by supplier ID https://issuetracking.bsh-sdd.com/browse/FU-6893[FU-6893] and Distributionsets for OEM can be created https://issuetracking.bsh-sdd.com/browse/FU-6751[FU-6751]

.New package structure:
* REU development:

** firmware-repository-rgc-homeconnectfds-cn/fds/packages_production/
** with subfolders
*** internal for BSH internal/1 update packages
*** oem/<supplierId> for OEM supplied update packages with their supplierId#

.*Create DS for oem via bulk-distribution-set*

** Superds for OEM (adjust supplierId to something different than 1)
- _get hash of the up and check in the AWS repo_

** Superds for SYMANA

** Superds without supplier id
